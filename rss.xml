            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Giant Galaxy Orbiting Our Own Just Appeared Out of Nowhere</h1><p>Researchers scanning the skies just got a big surprise. They spotted a humongous galaxy orbiting our own, where none had been seen before. It appeared, seemingly, out of nowhere.

Facebook Live video has boomed in a big way with people shooting on their phones, and lots of those users aren't going to shell out for a $399 external camera.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4466be094e86bad9c0e2fe4c5a74c3d32ef5c016.jpg"></article>]]></description>

And now, animal photographer Greg Murray is capturing this magic in his photo book For the Love of Peanut Butter .</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6cde08334123e2f7fe684250a00b0ba6d03a29fe.jpg"></article>]]></description>
